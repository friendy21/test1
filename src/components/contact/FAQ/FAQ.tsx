      question: "What happens during a demo?",
      answer: "During your personalized demo, one of our workplace analytics specialists will walk you through the Glynac platform with specific examples relevant to your industry and organizational challenges. You'll see how our dashboards work, how insights are generated, and have the opportunity to ask questions specific to your situation. Demos typically last 30-45 minutes."
